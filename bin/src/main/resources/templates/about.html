  <h1>Zenon Stack</h1>
  <p>Digital Platform Strategy and Tailored Development Solutions for ensuring streamlined platform integration, architecture implementation and Migration.</p>
  <p1>Xeon Phi[2] was a series of x86 manycore processors designed and made by Intel. It was intended for use in supercomputers, servers, and high-end workstations. Its architecture allowed use of standard programming languages and application programming interfaces (APIs) such as OpenMP.[3][4]

    Xeon Phi launched in 2010. Since it was originally based on an earlier GPU design (codenamed "Larrabee") by Intel[5] that was cancelled in 2009,[6] it shared application areas with GPUs. The main difference between Xeon Phi and a GPGPU like Nvidia Tesla was that Xeon Phi, with an x86-compatible core, could, with less modification, run software that was originally targeted to a standard x86 CPU.

    Initially in the form of PCIe-based add-on cards, a second-generation product, codenamed Knights Landing, was announced in June 2013.[7] These second-generation chips could be used as a standalone CPU, rather than just as an add-in card.


    The Tianhe-2 supercomputer uses Xeon Phi processors.
